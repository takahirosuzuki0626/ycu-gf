abstract: Targeted-protein enhancement is of importance not only for the study of biological processes but also for therapeutic and biotechnological applications. Here, we present a method to selectively up-regulate protein expression of desired genes in cultured cells by means of synthetic antisense non-coding RNAs known as SINEUPs. This positive control of gene expression is at the post-transcriptional level and exerted by an inverted short interspersed nuclear element (SINE) repeat at the 3ʹ end of SINEUPs that comprises its effector domain (ED). SINEUPs can specifically bind to any protein-coding mRNA of choice through its binding domain (BD), a region designed to complement the sequence within the 5ʹ untranslated region (5ʹ UTR) and around the start codon of the mRNA. Target-specific SINEUPs designed in this manner are transfected to cultured cells, and protein and RNA are extracted for downstream analyses, generally 24-48 h post-transfection. SINEUP-induced protein up-regulation is detected by Western-blot analysis and RNA expression is measured using real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR. We have observed that BD design is critical for achieving optimum SINEUP activity and that testing different BD sizes and positions with respect to the start codon of the target mRNA is recommended. Therefore, we describe here a semi-automated high-throughput imaging method based on fluorescence detection that can be implemented to target mRNA fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP). SINEUPs specifically enhance translation within normal physiological range of the cell, without altering the target transcript level. This method has been successfully employed against a range of endogenous and exogenous targets, in a wide variety of human, mouse, and insect cell lines along with in vivo systems. Moreover, SINEUPs have been reported to increase antibody production and work as an RNA therapeutic against haploinsufficient genes. The versatile and modular nature of SINEUPs makes them a suitable tool for gene-specific translational control.
